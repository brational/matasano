but do cryptopals
my thoughts for cryptopals:
write clean functions for a lot of the stuff and put them in a "utils" file somewhere - you'll be using them a lot

dont spend too much time on the first 6 (for #3 / #6 you can write a nice scoring function _really quickly_ - dont bust your balls)
use python
(for problem 7 and onward, download PyCrypto and use that for AES ("pip install pycrypto"))

dont do problem 19
lol

ask me about problem 23 when you get there (this was the only problem I had to cheat on when I was doing them)

how about i get through set 1 first

lol yeah

first 6 are fun and should be relatively simple but people get hung up on them (as the comment on the cryptopals site says, it took me 2 weeks to do)
but then you start getting into the real cool stuff (block cipher modes)
so id suggest muscling through them
